# Simple-Chatbot-NLTK
a simple chatbot is implemented using natural language processing techniques. The chatbot utilizes the NLTK library and cosine similarity to generate responses based on user input.

The initial setup involves importing necessary libraries, downloading NLTK data, and reading a text file ('chatbot.txt') that presumably contains information relevant to the chatbot's responses.

The code defines functions for greeting detection (greeting), tokenization, and lemmatization (LemTokens and LemNormalize). The main functionality lies in the response function, which calculates the cosine similarity between the user's input and existing sentences in the corpus to generate an appropriate response.

The chatbot engages in a conversation with the user through a simple loop. It responds to greetings and attempts to provide relevant answers to user queries. The conversation continues until the user inputs "bye," at which point the chatbot bids farewell.

It's important to note that the effectiveness of this chatbot is limited to the information present in the 'chatbot.txt' file and the simplicity of the implemented algorithms. For a more sophisticated chatbot, a larger dataset and advanced natural language processing models could be employed.
